Despite widespread belief that this concept was developed in the first half of the twentieth century, its origins are in fact to be found in the early eighteenth century. After reconstructing the game analysis of Montmort, Waldegrave, and Bernoulli using modern methods and terminology, I argue that their discussion of the concept of solution to a game also anticipated refinements of the concept of equilibrium that we typically associate with the second half of the twentieth century.",

abstract = {A quantum game in the Eisert scheme is defined by the payoff matrix, plus some quantum entanglement parameters. In the symmetric nonzero-sum 2x2 games, the relevant features of the game are given by two parameters in the payoff matrix, and only one extra entanglement parameter is introduced by quantizing it in the Eisert scheme. The criteria adopted in this work to classify quantum games are the amount and characteristics of Nash equilibria and Pareto-optimal positions. A new classification based on them is developed for symmetric nonzero-sum classical 2x2 games, as well as classifications for quantum games with different restricted subsets of the total strategy set. Finally, a classification is presented taking the whole set of strategies into account, both unitary strategies and nonunitary strategies studied as convex mixures of unitary strategies. The classification reproduces features which have been previously found in other works, like appearance of multiple equilibria, changes in the character of equilibria, and entanglement regime transitions.},

@Comment @article{Hadfield-Menell2016,
@Comment abstract = {It is clear that one of the primary tools we can use to mitigate the potential risk from a misbehaving AI system is the ability to turn the system off. As the capabilities of AI systems improve, it is important to ensure that such systems do not adopt subgoals that prevent a human from switching them off. This is a challenge because many formulations of rational agents create strong incentives for self-preservation. This is not caused by a built-in instinct, but because a rational agent will maximize expected utility and cannot achieve whatever objective it has been given if it is dead. Our goal is to study the incentives an agent has to allow itself to be switched off. We analyze a simple game between a human H and a robot R, where H can press R's off switch but R can disable the off switch. A traditional agent takes its reward function for granted: we show that such agents have an incentive to disable the off switch, except in the special case where H is perfectly rational. Our key insight is that for R to want to preserve its off switch, it needs to be uncertain about the utility associated with the outcome, and to treat H's actions as important observations about that utility. (R also has no incentive to switch itself off in this setting.) We conclude that giving machines an appropriate level of uncertainty about their objectives leads to safer designs, and we argue that this setting is a useful generalization of the classical AI paradigm of rational agents.},

abstract = {We study new classes of games, called zero-sum equivalent games and zero-sum equivalent potential games, and prove decomposition theorems involving these classes of games. We say that two games are "strategically equivalent" if, for every player, the payoff differences between two strategies (holding other players' strategies fixed) are identical. A zero-sum equivalent game is a game that is strategically equivalent to a zero-sum game; a zero-sum equivalent potential game is a zero-sum equivalent game that is strategically equivalent to a common interest game. We also call a game "normalized" if the sum of one player's payoffs, given the other players' strategies, is always zero. We show that any normal form game can be uniquely decomposed into either (i) a zero-sum equivalent game and a normalized common interest game, or (ii) a zero-sum equivalent potential game, a normalized zero-sum game, and a normalized common interest game, each with distinctive equilibrium properties. For example, we show that two-player zero-sum equivalent games with finite strategy sets generically have a unique Nash equilibrium and that two-player zero-sum equivalent potential games with finite strategy sets generically have a strictly dominant Nash equilibrium.},

We provide a series of maps of subspaces induced by restricting the notion of neighbourhood in a natural way. We briefly compare the topologically based classification with typologies produced Rapoport and Guyer (1966), developed further in Rapoport, Guyer and Gordon, (1976) and Brams. (1994).},

abstract = {Deductive equilibrium analysis often fails to provide a unique equilibrium solution in many situations of strategic interdependence. Consequently, a theory of equilibrium selection would be a useful complement to the theory of equilibrium points. A salient equilibrium selection principle would allow decision makers to implement a mutual best response outcome. This paper uses the experimental method to examine the salience of payoff-dominance, security, and historical precedents in related average opinion games. The systematic and, hence, predictable behavior observed in the experiments suggests that it should be possible to construct an accurate theory of equilibrium selection.},

@Comment abstract = {It is clear that one of the primary tools we can use to mitigate the potential risk from a misbehaving AI system is the ability to turn the system off. As the capabilities of AI systems improve, it is important to ensure that such systems do not adopt subgoals that prevent a human from switching them off. This is a challenge because many formulations of rational agents create strong incentives for self-preservation. This is not caused by a built-in instinct, but because a rational agent will maximize expected utility and cannot achieve whatever objective it has been given if it is dead. Our goal is to study the incentives an agent has to allow itself to be switched off. We analyze a simple game between a human H and a robot R, where H can press R's off switch but R can disable the off switch. A traditional agent takes its reward function for granted: we show that such agents have an incentive to disable the off switch, except in the special case where H is perfectly rational. Our key insight is that for R to want to preserve its off switch, it needs to be uncertain about the utility associated with the outcome, and to treat H's actions as important observations about that utility. (R also has no incentive to switch itself off in this setting.) We conclude that giving machines an appropriate level of uncertainty about their objectives leads to safer designs, and we argue that this setting is a useful generalization of the classical AI paradigm of rational agents.},

abstract = {1st ed. Watching players bluff in a poker game inspired John von Neumann--father of the modern computer and one of the sharpest minds of the century--to construct game theory, a mathematical study of conflict and deception. Game theory was embraced at the RAND Corporation, the think tank charged with formulating military strategy for the atomic age, and in 1950 two RAND scientists discovered the "prisoner's dilemma"--A disturbing game where two or more people may betray the common good for individual gain. The prisoner's dilemma quickly became a popular allegory of the nuclear arms race. Game theory developed into a controversial tool of public policy--alternately accused of justifying arms races and touted as the only hope of preventing them. Biographer Poundstone weaves together a biography of the brilliant and tragic von Neumann, a history of pivotal phases of the cold war, and an investigation of game theory's far-reaching influence.--From publisher description. 1.

@book{Gomes-Casseres1996,
abstract = {More than we ever anticipated, alliances among firms are changing the way business is conducted, particularly in the global, high-technology sector. The reasons are clear: companies must increasingly pool their capabilities to succeed in ever more complex and rapidly changing businesses. But the consequences for managers and for the economy have so far been underestimated. In this new book, Benjamin Gomes-Casseres presents the first in-depth account of the new world of business alliances and shows how collaboration has become part of the very fabric of modern competition.Alliances, he argues, create new units of competition that do battle with one another and with traditional single firms. The flexible capabilities of these multi-firm constellations give them advantages over single firms in certain contexts, offsetting the advantage of a single firm's unified control. When managed effectively, alliances can strengthen a firm's competitive advantage and narrow the gap between leading firms and second-tier players. This often results in intensified rivalry, and the competition within an industry is transformed. Alliances often spread swiftly through an industry as firms jockey for advantage. Yet the very spread of alliances increases their costs and poses new limits on their use. Gomes-Casseres concludes that firms need to manage their constellations to enhance collaboration within their groups, while raising what he calls "barriers to collaboration" for rivals.These ideas are developed and illustrated through original case studies of alliances among U.S., Japanese, and European firms in electronics and computers, including Xerox, IBM, and Fujitsu as well as other small and large companies. The book should be of interest to business academics, managers, and general readers concerned with contemporary capitalism.},

abstract = {Undergraduate students often struggle to learn mathematics because introductory classes are taught in large lectures that do not engage students in active problem-solving. These students do not connect mathematics to their lives and feel that learning mathematics is a solitary undertaking. We now use Tablet PCs in a networked classroom to address these challenges. Students in classes that use the Tablet PCs can view and annotate the instructor's Powerpoint slides in real time and also participate in interactive problem-solving. Students save their own annotated slides for subsequent review. They also have immediate access to the synchronized screen capture and audio recording of the class since the instructor posts this file to the course management website. These technological interventions allow students to focus on classroom activities rather than on note-taking. To date, students have taken three introductory undergraduate mathematics courses (College Algebra and Trigonometry, Calculus I, and Calculus II) using Tablet PCs. Student attendance and retention were better in the cohort of students who participated in the Tablet PC courses than in comparable non-Tablet PC courses taught by the same instructor. The evaluation of the instructor was unchanged.},

The problem of cooperation is central to many different fields.

(Econometrica 69:749–764, 2001), our design keeps the riskiness ratio of the two strategies at a constant level as the optimization premium is increased. We define the riskiness ratio as the relative payoff range of the two strategies. We find that decreasing the riskiness ratio while keeping the optimization premium constant decreases sharply the frequency of the payoff-dominant equilibrium strategy. On the other hand an increase of the optimization premium with a constant riskiness ratio has no effect on the choice frequencies. Finally, we confirm the dynamic properties found by Battalio et al. that increasing the optimization premium favours best-response and sensitivity to the history of play.},

   abstract = {Game theory is the study of strategic interaction between rational agents. The need for understanding interaction arises in many different fields, such as: economics, psychology, philosophy, computer science and biology. The purpose of game theory is to analyse the outcomes and strategies of these interactions, in mathematical models called games. Some of these games have stood out from the rest, e.g. Prisoner's Dilemma, Chicken and Stag Hunt. These games, commonly referred to as the standard games, have attracted interest from many fields of research. In order to understand why these games are interesting and how they differ from each other and other games, many have attempted to sort games into interestingly different classes. In this thesis some already existing classifications are reviewed based on their mathematical structure and how well justified they are. Emphasis is put on mathematical simplicity because it makes the classification more generalisable to larger game spaces. From this review we conclude that none of the classifications captures both of these aspects. We therefore propose a classification of symmetric 2x2 games based on decomposition. We show that our proposed method captures everything that the previous classifications caputure. Our method arguably explains the interesting differences between the games, and we justify this claim by computer experiments. Moreover it has a simple mathematical structure. We also provide some results concerning the size of different game spaces. },
